# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name's Roman and I'm currently a student at Ukrainian Catholic University and also an aspiring Front-end Web Developer!
I'm very interested in anything web dev related + one of my biggest passions is art, so UI/UX design is also something I'm constantly trying to learn more about.
The newest passion of mine is game developing, even though for now it's just a hobby ðŸ˜…... I have some private projects related to browser games and some other minor game-related pieces of code and I would love to get some experience in developing browser and/or desktop game applications.
